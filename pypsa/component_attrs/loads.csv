control_strategy,string,n/a,n/a,"Inverter control type, supported types are: q_v (v1, v2, v3, v4, s_nom, power_factor, damper), fixed_cosphi (power_factor) , and cosphi_p (set_p1,  set_p2, s_nom, power_factor_min, p_ref), for futher details regarding supported control_types, read here:  https://pypsa.readthedocs.io/en/latest/power_flow.html .",Input (optional)
power_factor,static or series,n/a,1,"Power factor is default to 1 and can take values (0, 1], required when control_strategy is chosen ""fixed_cosphi"" and ""q_v"". This factor is used to calculate the amount of reactive power compensation according to the active power generation and the amount of available reactive power capacity  of the inverter.

v1,float,n/a,0.9,"Minimum voltage magnitude per unit for left curve of q_v controller, required when control_strategy is chosen  ""q_v"".  v1 togeather with v2, v3 and v4 are set points for q_v controller reactive power compensation curve. Controller decides the amount of reactive power after finding the location of v_mag_pu of the bus (inverter is connected to) on this curve. This curve has five zones according to possible locations for v_mag_pu of the controlled bus. Zone 1: where v_mag_pu bus is less than v1,  Zone 2: where v_mag_pu bus is between v1 and v2, Zone 3: where v_mag_pu bus is between v2 and v3, Zone 4: where v_mag_pu bus is between v3 and v4 and Zone 5: where v_mag_pu is greater than v4. Zone 1 is undervoltage case, Zone 2 is between normal and undervoltage, zone 3 is neutral zone where no compensation is needed, zone 4 is between normal range and overvoltage and zone 5 is the overvoltage zone. According to the location of v_mag_pu of the bus, controller will provide an amount of reactive power to bring the voltage as closer as possible to zone 3, Therefore, pay attention on choice of v2 and v3 since they form zone 3 where controller recognizes it as the zone that needs no reactive power compensation and uses it as the reference to provide reactive power for other zones occurance.  Note: Throughout the curve this relation v1 < v2 < v3 < v4 should be considered. For further details  https://pypsa.readthedocs.io/en/latest/power_flow.html.",Input (optional)

For zone 1, controller work with unity power factor (no reactive power compensation), for zone 2, controller chooses the right power factor according to the controller droop and for zone 3, controller work with power_factor_min for reactive power compensation.
